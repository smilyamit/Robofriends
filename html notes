#1 to print html templates in sublime
just type:  HTML + tab
#2in pycharm it will autmatically come when u save file in .html format

#3 in js why we use 3 equal sign ===
= to assign value
== to check only one condition (either value is same or not)
=== to check 2 condition (first it will check the value and second it will check type of data eg either it is string or not)
